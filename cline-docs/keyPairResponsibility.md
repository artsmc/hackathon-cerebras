# Key Pair Responsibility

## Project Overview & Business Context Summary
PolicyGlass is an AI-powered policy document analysis platform designed to help legal professionals, policymakers, and compliance officers understand complex policy documents. The application transforms dense regulatory text into actionable insights through visual flagging of potential issues, contradictions, and compliance concerns.

Business goals include providing an intuitive interface for policy analysis, achieving comprehensive document parsing, and maintaining clean architecture with proper separation of concerns. The platform targets legal compliance officers, government policy analysts, corporate regulatory teams, legislative researchers, and risk management professionals.
