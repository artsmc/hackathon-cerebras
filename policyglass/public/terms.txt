  • You must not already be restricted by Facebook for violations.  
  • You promise not to share your account or credentials with others, and you’re responsible for all activity under your account.

3. Your Commitments to Facebook  
  • Provide accurate information (e.g., name, email, birthdate).  
  • Keep your password confidential.  
  • Use Facebook only for permitted, lawful purposes.

4. Privacy and Personal Data  
  • Your use is governed by Facebook’s Privacy Policy (see Section II below).  
  • By using Facebook, you consent to the processing of your information as described in the Privacy Policy.

5. Content on Facebook  
  • “Your Content”: anything you upload, post or otherwise provide to Facebook (posts, photos, messages, comments).  
  • You retain ownership of your content.  
  • By posting, you grant Facebook a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, copy, distribute, reproduce, process, modify, publish, transmit, and display it in connection with providing the service. This license ends when your content is deleted unless others have shared it.

6. Facebook’s Content  
  • Facebook content (e.g., software, designs, graphics, text, logos) is owned by Meta or its licensors and protected by intellectual property laws.  
  • You may not reproduce, modify, create derivative works, or publicly display Facebook’s proprietary content without permission.

7. Respecting Others  
  • You may not bully, harass, or threaten others.  
  • You may not post hate speech, incite violence, or encourage criminal activity.  
  • You must respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe your IP has been infringed, you may submit a complaint under Facebook’s designated notice process.

8. Buying and Selling  
  • Some users may use Facebook to facilitate transactions (e.g., Marketplace).  
  • Facebook is not a party to any transactions between users and disclaims all liability arising from them.

9. Enforcement; Termination  
  • Facebook may remove your content, suspend or terminate your account if you violate the Terms or Community Standards.  
  • You may deactivate your account at any time.  
  • Upon termination, your license to use the service ends and Facebook may delete or cease to make available your content.

10. Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability  
  • Facebook is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties.  
  • Facebook disclaims implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.  
  • Facebook is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, nor for lost profits or data.  
  • The aggregate liability of Facebook under these Terms is limited to U.S. $1,000.

11. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration  
  • Most disputes must be resolved through binding individual arbitration, not class actions, unless you opt out within 30 days of first using Facebook.  
  • The arbitration will be conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (or ICC if you reside outside the U.S.).  
  • You and Facebook each waive the right to a jury trial, court trial, or to participate in a class or representative action.

12. Governing Law; Venue  
  • If arbitration is unavailable, disputes are governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S., without regard to conflict-of-law rules.  
  • Jurisdiction and venue are the state or federal courts in Santa Clara County, California.

13. Changes to These Terms  
  • Facebook may modify the Terms, with notice by posting the revised version or sending you an email.  
  • Changes become effective upon posting. Continued use of the service after changes indicates acceptance.

14. Miscellaneous  
  • Entire Agreement: These Terms and any amendments constitute the entire agreement between you and Facebook regarding the service.  
  • Severability: If any provision is invalid, the remainder remains in effect.  
  • No Waiver: Facebook’s failure to enforce a right is not a waiver of that right.
