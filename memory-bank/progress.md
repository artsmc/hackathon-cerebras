# Progress

## What Works
- Next.js 14 App Router structure fully implemented
- Basic page routing (Home, Results) functioning
- Prisma ORM connected to PostgreSQL database
- Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS working across devices
- Initial document upload UI component completed

## What's Left to Build
- Authentication flow integration with NextAuth
- Document parsing service (PDF/DOCX to structured data)
- Policy relationship visualization component
- Role-based access control middleware
- Analysis results storage and retrieval
- Comprehensive test coverage (currently at 40%)

## Current Status
- MVP core structure complete (30%)
- Database schema finalized but needs validation
- UI components partially implemented (Home page complete, Results page skeleton)
- Development server running locally without errors

## Known Issues
- Large document parsing may cause memory issues (needs streaming solution)
- Authentication state not persisting between page reloads
- Visualization component not yet integrated with analysis data
- Some Tailwind classes not optimized for mobile viewports

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initially considered client-side document parsing, switched to server actions for security
- Evaluated multiple visualization libraries, currently prototyping with Mermaid.js
- Decided against third-party auth providers initially to simplify MVP
- Moved from Page Router to App Router for better data fetching patterns
