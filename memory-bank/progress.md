# Progress

## What Works
- Next.js 15 App Router structure fully implemented
- Basic page routing (Home, Dashboard, Admin, Results) functioning
- Prisma ORM connected to SQLite database
- Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS and Sass working across devices
- Complete authentication system:
  * User registration with validation
  * User login with JWT token generation
  * User logout with session invalidation
  * Password reset request and confirmation
  * Account locking after failed login attempts
  * Password history tracking
  * Banned password checking
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
  * User and admin roles
  * Protected pages middleware
  * Admin-only API routes
  * Conditional rendering based on roles
- Database operations:
  * User management
  * Session tracking
  * Audit logging
  * Password security features
- Frontend components:
  * LoginForm, RegisterForm, PasswordReset forms
  * AuthCheck wrapper component
  * Dashboard with role-based content
  * Admin dashboard and user management page
  * Policy analysis results page with toggleable report view

## What's Left to Build
- Document parsing service (PDF/DOCX to structured data)
- AI-powered policy analysis engine
- Policy relationship visualization component
- Document storage and management system
- Comprehensive test coverage (currently minimal)
- Admin user management interface with full API integration
- Audit log viewing and filtering for admin users
- System settings configuration page
- Database seeding for banned passwords
- Email service integration for password reset links
- Analysis results storage and retrieval
- Policy document upload functionality

## Current Status
- Authentication system: 100% complete and functional
- User interface: 60% complete (auth flows + basic policy analysis UI)
- Database schema: 100% implemented with all security features
- API routes: 80% complete (auth system fully implemented)
- RBAC implementation: 100% complete
- Policy analysis engine: 0% (placeholder UI only)
- Test coverage: 20% (basic frontend components tested)
- Overall project progress: 45% complete

## Known Issues
- Password reset emails are not actually sent (console.log only)
- User management page shows placeholder data instead of API integration
- Policy analysis is currently placeholder UI with no real AI processing
- Session cleanup and expiration handling needs refinement
- Audit log viewing not implemented for admin users
- No actual document parsing or storage functionality
- Password reset token validation needs additional security measures

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initially considered client-side document parsing, switched to server actions for security
- Evaluated multiple visualization libraries, currently prototyping with custom UI components
- Decided against third-party auth providers initially to simplify MVP
- Moved from Page Router to App Router for better data fetching patterns
- Added comprehensive password security features (history, banned passwords, account locking)
- Implemented JWT-based session management with database tracking for better security audit
- Chose SQLite for local development with migration path to PostgreSQL for production
- Used hybrid styling approach (Tailwind CSS + Sass) for flexibility and customization
